                <hr>
                <p class="small-text subtag"><br>The global drone market is segmented based on product, payload,
                    application, type, and region.<br>

                    Based on type, the market is bifurcated into fixed-wing drones and rotary-wing drones. The rotary
                    wing
                    segment held the largest market share in 2022 and is further expected to grow rapidly at a
                    significant
                    CAGR during the forecast period. The major reason for the growth of this segment is the rising
                    demand
                    for rotary blade drones for inspection purposes, as they can hover and maneuver quickly while
                    keeping a
                    close eye on a specific target for extended periods. They are viewed as a viable option for various
                    business applications, including surveillance, filmmaking, photography, and monitoring. <br>
                    Based on application, the market is segmented into construction, agriculture, energy, media and
                    entertainment, law enforcement, and other application. The media and entertainment segment held the
                    dominating market share in 2022 and is further predicted to grow at a promising CAGR during the
                    forecast
                    period. </p>

                <hr>
                <p class="small-text subtag"><br>Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling
                    drones to become more autonomous and intelligent. This means they can perform tasks with less human
                    intervention, such as autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and even decision-making.
                    Perferendis, reiciendis, facilis voluptatibus, optio hic.One of the most significant advancements AI
                    brings to drone technology is enhanced autonomy. Traditional drones relied heavily on human
                    operators to control their flight paths, which limited their range, endurance, and complexity.
                    However, with AI algorithms, drones can now process vast amounts of data in real-time, enabling them
                    to make autonomous decisions based on their surroundings.
                    <br>AI-powered drones incorporate advanced computer vision systems, utilizing cameras and sensors to
                    perceive their environment accurately. These systems enable drones to navigate complex terrains,
                    detect and avoid obstacles, and even perform precision maneuvers. By leveraging machine learning
                    algorithms, drones continuously improve their capabilities, learning from each flight and becoming
                    more efficient and reliable with time.

                <p class="small-text subtag"><br>The concept of UAM envisions drones and electric vertical takeoff and
                    landing (eVTOL) aircraft providing on-demand transportation services in urban areas. <br>Urban Air
                    Mobility (UAM) refers to the emerging field of aviation that focuses on the use of electric vertical
                    takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and drones to provide on-demand, environmentally friendly
                    transportation solutions within urban areas. UAM aims to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce carbon
                    emissions, and enhance mobility by offering short-range, efficient aerial transportation for
                    passengers and cargo. It encompasses a wide range of applications, including air taxis, delivery
                    services, and emergency medical transport, all powered by electric propulsion systems. UAM is at the
                    forefront of technological innovation, regulatory development, and urban planning efforts as cities
                    explore the integration of these aircraft into their transportation networks to create more
                    sustainable and efficient urban environments.</p>
